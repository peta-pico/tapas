Tapas
=====

Tapas is a triple store user interface based on
[grlc](https://github.com/CLARIAH/grlc) and
[YASR](https://github.com/OpenTriply/YASGUI.YASR), and **work in progress**.

You can play around with it [here](http://www.tkuhn.eculture.labs.vu.nl/tapas/tapas.html), for example by using the API [albertmeronyo/lodapi](http://www.tkuhn.eculture.labs.vu.nl/tapas/tapas.html?api=albertmeronyo/lodapi).
